An attempt to make web2py work with multiple authentication mechanisms.

Features:
 * twitter login via OAuth
 * facebook login via javascript SDK/Graph API
 * google login via OAuth
 * web2py standard login
 * all accounts are joined via email address (so twitter login sends you
    to a form to enter your email)
 * only a logged in user should be allowed to add a twitter account to their
    email address (so twitter email form disallows use of existing email
    address)

TODO:
 * make this a real web2py plugin

INSTALL:
 * site-packages should go to web2py/site-packages.  facebook.py is a modified
   form of the API provided by facebook, but it uses gluon.tools.fetch for
   URL fetching so that it will run on GAE (and urllib2 seems to work better
   than urllib that they were using)
 * modules to your modules folder.
 * controlers to your controllers folder
 * views to your views folder.
 * add twitter keys to controllers/auth_ext.py
 * add facebook keys to controllers/auth_ext.py and views/facebook_init.html
 * configure facebook and twitter applications from their respecitve websites
 * fix login_area.html to be a full complete HTML page (i use it as an include)
 * upgrade your database if needed to have the fields of the custom auth_user
   table
